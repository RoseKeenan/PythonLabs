# PythonLabs
Lab assignments for CIS 1051 at Temple University. Super simple but good beginner programming assignments!

This course was my very first programming course ever! Prior to this, I had barely worked with any type of programming and was
very unfamiliar with everything. However, I found problem solving to be fun! Although I was a total beginner, 
I found these assignments and this class to be enjoyable.
